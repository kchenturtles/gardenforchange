Utilizing advanced modern technology, home gardens could become the next powerful weapons against climate change. From harnessing smart irrigation systems that optimize water usage to exploring climate-resilient crop varieties that stand tall against the elements, I'm dedicated to uncovering the innovative ways in which agritech can transform our gardening practices to the health of the planet.

I aim to use my passion for computer science and technology to spread awareness about the power of individuals and entrepreneurs, to beneficially influence the planet by starting home gardens or utilizing technology to support sustainable farming.
