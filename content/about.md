Robotics is the future. From autonomous cars to wearable technoloy, robotics is taking more and more forms that are changing our lives in unimaginable ways. Utilizing advanced robotic technology could become the next strategy against climate change. This starts in our food system, one of the biggest consumers of water, land, and natural resources on the planet, as well as one of the biggest polluters. From supporting home gardeners to finding ways to make farming greener, I'm dedicated to uncovering the innovative ways in which agritech can transform our food practices to the health of the planet.

I aim to use my passion for computer science and robotics to spread awareness about the power of individuals and entrepreneurs, to beneficially influence the planet by starting home gardens or utilizing technology to support sustainable farming.
