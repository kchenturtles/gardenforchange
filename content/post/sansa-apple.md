I love visiting nearby farmer's markets during the summer and fall to support local farms and get access to some really awesome produce! 

I've always been fascinated with apples -- so many _varieties_! -- but they only sell a few varieties in supermarkets. In reality, there are thousands and thousands of American apple varities dating back to the colonial period, not to mention the number of types of apples grown all over the world! Apples are easily cross-pollinated, and they actually aren't "true to seed," which means that if you plant the seeds of one type of apple it may grow an entirely different variety! Because of this, most apple orchards utilize grafting, which is growing apples from a part (such as a stem or a branch) of a tree of the desired apple variety, instead of growing them from seeds. However, hybridization can be good! Many of the apples popular today -- such as Granny Smith or SugarBee -- were discovered as chance seedlings or chance hybridizations of different apple varieties. Since there's so many varieties of apples out there, I figured I'd review some of the ones I've picked up at local farmer's markets to get people excited to try them as well!

We're kicking things off with the **Sansa** apple, a cultivar native to New England that first hit the markets in 1988. It is a cross between the well-known Gala and the lesser-known Akane. I found this apple at the Belmont Farmer's Market! It's definitely an early-season apple. Sansa is a gorgeous light yellow color with no hint of green. Its blush is red with some pink ribbing. It's also on the smaller side. 

Upon biting in, this apple is relatively fine-grained and relatively juicy. It's sweet like its Gala parent, but has a little bit more complexity of flavor with a little bit of a citrusy finish. Perhaps it's just the creamy color, but this apple to me had almost a hint of banana flavor. Worth trying if you can find it!
