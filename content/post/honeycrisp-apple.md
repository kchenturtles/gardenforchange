**Honeycrisp** is a shining star in the world of apple cultivars. It was bred in the 1960s at the University of Minnesota, and hit the markets in the early 1990s. Honeycrisp's parentage includes Macoun and Honeygold, where it gets its name from. Honeycrisp is now one of the most popular apple varieties on the market, and has inspired many crosses to imitate its flavor. Unfortunately, Honeycrisp is more labor-intensive to grow, and thus can be much more expensive than some other varieties. The apple has thin skin that is easily punctured by other fruits' stems during transport. Additionally, Honeycrisp trees are especially susceptible to disease.

So the question is, are Honeycrisp worth it? I got this apple from a local farm that does pick-your-own apples. These locally grown apples tend to be on the smaller side but each tree produces more apples. On an industrial scale, oftentimes some blossoms are removed from Honeycrisp trees to allow the remaining fruits to grow bigger. You can recognize a Honeycrisp by its light green skin with iconic red streaks. It's a blocky apple, and tends to come with a stem attached because it it often hand cut.

Honeycrisps are renowned for their sweet, fruity, and floral flavor, and for their juicy crunch. The apple that I picked was left in storage for a bit (my bad!) so it was likely less crisp than one fresh off the tree would have been. However, it was still remarkably enjoyable, with especial sweetness near the blossom and stem ends of the apple.
