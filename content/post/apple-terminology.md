I figured, since I'm making a series about apples, I should make a glossary of terms that are commonly used when talking about apples.

(Yes, I'm really doing this. No, I'm not obsessed.)

Let's start with the basics:

## Basic Apple Terminology

- **Pomology:** Pomology is the branch of horticulture that focuses on the study and cultivation of fruit, including apples.
- **Cider:** Cider is a beverage made from fermented apple juice. It can vary in sweetness, alcohol content, and flavor, depending on the production method and apple varieties used. In colonial America, cider was exclusively alcoholic; nowadays it is more common to refer to alcoholic ciders as "hard cider."
- **Variety:** Variety refers to the different types of apples available, each with its own distinct flavor, appearance, and texture. 
- **Cultivar:** A cultivar is a cultivated variety of apple (cultivated + variety = cultivar) that has been developed through selective breeding for specific traits, such as taste, size, or disease resistance. Cultivars are different from varieties in that they have been developed. A chance seedling is a variety, but it may not be a cultivar.
- **Pippin:** A pippin apple is one that has grown from seed. Most cultivated apples these days are grown from grafting.
- **Heirloom:** An heirloom apple is a traditional or vintage apple variety that has been cultivated and passed down through generations for many years, often decades or even centuries. These apple varieties have historical significance and are valued for their unique and often distinctive flavors, appearances, and characteristics. 

## Terms Used In Growing Apples

- **Grafting:** Grafting is a horticultural technique used to join together parts of two or more plants to create a single plant. It's a common method employed in the propagation of apple cultivars. 
- **Scion:** A scion is a small section of a desired apple tree variety that is grafted onto a rootstock. The scion is typically a young shoot or branch with several buds. When grafted, the scion has the potential to develop into a new apple tree that produces the same type of apples as the parent tree from which the scion was taken.
- **Rootstock:** A rootstock is the lower portion of a grafted apple tree onto which a scion (the desired apple variety) is joined. 
- **Blight:** Blight is a highly contagious bacterial disease that can affect apple trees. It is caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora and can result in severe damage to apple harvests if not managed effectively. 
- **Watercore:** Watercore is an issue that can damage an apple's internal fruit tissue. It is characterized by the accumulation of water or sugary sap in the cells of the apple's flesh, typically near the core. A sign of watercore is a glassy, watery zone of flesh inside of an apple.

## Visual Descriptors

- **Blossom & Stem Ends:** The blossom end is the end of the apple where the flower once bloomed and where the fruit developed. It is usually the rounder or slightly indented end of the apple, and is opposite to the stem end. The stem end of the apple is where the fruit was attached to the apple tree's stem or branch.
- **Calyx:** The calyx of an apple refers to the cluster of sepals at the blossom end of the apple. The calyx is the remnant of the flower from which the apple developed. Every apple has a calyx, although its appearance may differ: some are open, some are closed, some are indented, and some are not.
- **Lobes:** Lobes are protrusions or rounded bumps that can be found at the blossom end of an apple, giving the shape of a crown. (The lobes are sometimes also called the crown of an apple.) They can vary in size, shape, and prominence depending on the apple variety. An apple with very prominent lobes is the Red Delicious.
- **Lenticels:** Lenticels on apples are small, porous structures on the fruit's skin that allow for the exchange of gases during respiration -- or essentially, letting the apple "breathe." They naturally occur on all apples, although they may be more noticeable on some varieties than on others. _Cosmic Crisp_ is a well-known apple cultivar that gets its branding from the "starlike" white lenticels scattered across its skin.
- **Russeting:** Apple russeting is a common skin disorder or cosmetic condition that affects some apple varieties. It appears as rough, brown, corky, or scaly patches on the surface of the apple's skin, giving it a textured or slightly blemished appearance. Some varieties of apples are likely to develop russeting -- and thus the word "russet" is found in many older apple names. Russeting does not affect the inside of the apple, but it can impact the fruit's marketability. Unfortunately in the modern day, many heirloom apple varieties prone to russeting are not commonly found in supermarkets due to this issue.
- **Blush:** Blush on an apple is a reddish or rosy patch that appears on apples where they have been exposed to the sun. In many apple varieties, the apple under the blush will be green or yellow. Blush can vary in intensity and pattern depending on the apple variety and its growing conditions. Not all apple cultivars will develop blush.
- **Ribbing:** Ribbing refers to streaks of color often seen on an apple, often in shades of contrasting colors. Ribbing can vary depending on the variety of apple; some apples will not have any.

## Taste & Texture:

- **Vinous:** Vinous refers to the word "vino," or "wine" in Latin. Indeed, some apples are described as having a flavor like wine. This descriptor is often used for the Winesap and McIntosh cultivars.
- **Subacid:** "Subacid" is literally "less acidic." In an apple, this typically means that it is a pleasing balance between sour and sweet. 
- **Mealy:** Often times apples that have gotten too old will become mealy. Mealy apples are less crisp, more granular, or have an almost dry texture when bitten into. Keep in mind that some apples are naturally softer, and this is different from being mealy. Mealy apples will feel almost crumbly in texture.
- **Graining:** Graining refers to the texture inside an apple. "Coarse-grained" apples have larger cells that have the capacity for more water. This makes them especially juicy and crunchy. "Fine-grained" apples will tend towards a more smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel and will be less juicy.
