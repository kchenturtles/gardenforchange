The Ginger Gold is gaining popularity in supermarkets. I've seen it in my local Market Basket a few times! Its parentage is unknown, but theorized to be in the Golden Delicious family (perhaps with Abelmarle Pippin as another parent). Despite its name, most of the Ginger Gold apples I've found have been green, although they can develop a pink blush. They tend to be fairly large, and have noticeable lobes like a Red Delicious.

The Ginger Gold I picked up was definitely picked on the less-ripe side, since it was a little more green and tart than some of the ones I remember having before. It was a little bit reminiscent of a Granny Smith, albeit with a lighter, crispier crunch and more coarse-grained flesh. Flavor notes reminded me of pear and sour grape. 

Interested in finding a more ripe Ginger Gold next time, but nevertheless this was a nice apple!
