Zestar is a great name for an apple. This is one in an array of successful apple cultivars developed and released by the University of Minnesota -- other apples developed there include Honeycrisp and Sweet 16! Zestar was released in 1999 and is a cross between Conell Red and Goodland. Fun fact: Zestar is one of the parents, along with Honeycrisp, of another popular apple developed by the University of Minnesota: SweeTango.

Zestar is a light green color. It has a nice, patchy pale red blush with little white lenticels. The one that I got from the Belmont Farmer's Market still had the leaf attached, which was very cute! Biting in, it has a very white flesh, reminiscent of a McIntosh. The flavor is as complex as a Mac as well, although I don't know if they're actually related. Zestar is a little bit sour and a little bit sweet, with enough spice and complexity to keep things interesting. I like the texture as well: fine-grained and a little on the drier side -- not unpleasantly so, just enough to give it a bit of crisp. All in all, I think Zestar strikes a great balance of flavor and texture!
