The exact origin of the Golden Russet apple is unclear, but it is believed to have originated in the northeastern United States or in Europe. It is considered an American heirloom variety. It apple likely gained prominence in the late 18th century or early 19th century in the United States. It was first recognized for its unique characteristics in New York and New England. 

The Golden Russet apple earned its name from its distinct golden-yellow skin and intense russeting, which gives it a rough, bronze-colored texture. Unfortunately, russeted apples have largely fallen out of popularity in most supermarkets due to their diminished attractiveness. You'll likely only be able to find russeted apples at local farmer's markets, which was where I found this one! It tends to be fairly round, and mine had a few blemishes, but that's not a real issue.

This apple was fairly soft but still juicy, with a spicy flavor reminiscent of pear. It is sweet without a hint of sourness. It has a thin skin and breaks off easily and satisfyingly. Much more complex than your average Gala!
