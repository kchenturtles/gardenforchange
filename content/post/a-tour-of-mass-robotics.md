Recently I was given the opportunity to get a tour inside MassRobotics. Located in Boston's Seaport District, MassRobotics is a nonprofit robotics innovation hub whose mission is to aid entrepreneurs and startups working in robotics, technology, and connected devices by providing the workspace and resources for conceptualizing, prototyping, testing, scaling, and manufacturing. MassRobotics operates as a hub for the robotics ecosystem across New England and the world, connecting startups with established companies, academic institutions, and industry leaders.

The organization's values revolve around its culture of innovation and collaboration. MassRobotics provides an open environment for robotics groups to prototype, test technologies and work towards the advancement of robotic systems. It offers emerging companies access to resources such as technical mentorship and guidance, networking opportunities, and funding avenues. By facilitating these connections, MassRobotics plays an important role in accelerating the development of robotic solutions.

I was lucky enough to tour MassRobotics' space in Boston's Seaport District. MassRobotics provides access to top-of-the-line manufacturing equipment and robotics technology, from CNC machines and laser cutters to robotic arms! Thanks to partnerships with industry companies such as SolidWorks and AutoDesk, MassRobotics is able to connect its startups to the latest technologies. Startups working out of MassRobotics range greatly in size. Some groups may have a private office, while others might use a lab bench -- the organization aims to provide an entry point for startups in all stages. Successful startups may move on to independent spaces. But, no matter the size, MassRobotics is a great launching pad for dozens of robotics startups spanning a whole range of markets.  

MassRobotics also operates as an educational powerhouse, partnering with educational institutions to inspire the next generation of roboticists. Through workshops, seminars, and hands-on programs, the organization cultivates a pipeline of young talent with the skills and knowledge necessary to shape the future of robotics. MassRobotics aims to inspire the next generation of innovators, facilitate relationships between students and the robotics community, and create programs and classrooms to give students proficiency in navigating the world of technology that we live in.

Furthermore, MassRobotics serves as a bridge between the robotics industry and external stakeholders, including government bodies, regulatory agencies, and investors. MassRobotics holds a yearly "Robot Block Parade" to excite the public about innovations in the field of robotics. Through advocating for favorable policies and fostering a beneficial public view of robotics, MassRobotics has made a great impact on the expansion and sustainability of the robotics sector. I am so grateful to MassRobotics for giving me the opportunity to tour, and I hope to work more with this organization!
