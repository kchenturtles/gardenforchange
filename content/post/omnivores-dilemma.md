I first read _The Omnivore's Dilemma_ in 7th grade. This was the book that convinced me to go vegetarian.

Written by acclaimed food journalist Michael Pollan, _The Omnivore's Dilemma_ delves into the tangle of America's farming industries and explores the questionable nature of the methods used in the modern food inustry. Through three "meals" of very different origins, Pollan delves into one by one the practices of industrial agriculture, organic farming, and alternative farming to show readers the vast differences in how food might get to their table.

Pollan begins the book in a field of corn: the industrial corn farm of modern American agriculture. He follows the trail of corn from its cultivation in vast monocultures to its presence in processed foods, shining a spotlight on the extensive impact this crop has had on the food system, and the economic factors that have allowed it to creep into the majority of foods on shelves today. Furthermore, Pollan's description of practices used in factory farming exposes the effect that corn has on animals raised for consumption.

In his second "meal," Pollan reveals some complicating truths about so-called "organic" produce, peeling back public misconceptions equating organic farming with humane, sustainable farming. Pollan reveals the continuing influence of economics on the organic industry, pushing organic growers to industrialize and economize production like any other factory farm while disseminating a perception of idyllic, natural farming.

Finally, Pollan introduces readers to a third alternative through his sojourn at Joel Salatin's Polyface Farm, which utilizes innovative regenerative farming techniques. By highlighting Salatin's holistic farming approach, Pollan showcases a sustainable model that prioritizes natural recycling practices, humane treatment of animals, and sustaining the health of the land.

Pollan's exploration of the journey from field to plate serves as a wake-up call to the majority of American consumers, greatly disconnected from or unaware of their food sources. He delves into the concept of "food miles," shedding light on the environmental cost of long-distance shipping and encouraging readers to consider the significance of supporting local agriculture.

_The Omnivore's Dilemma_ makes a strong case for readers to be conscientious consumers, by "voting with their forks". Some steps I have taken (and encourage others to do as well!) to limit my impact on the environment and to promote humane treatment of animals have been:

- Eating a vegetarian diet, as I refuse to support factory farming practices
- Buying from and supporting local farmer's markets and local produce
- Buying produce "in season" to reduce the shipping of produce across the globe
- Growing my own vegetables at home in my garden
- Reducing food waste by finding ways to use more parts of produce that I buy -- such as [watermelon rind kimchi!](https://food52.com/recipes/83742-watermelon-rind-kimchi-recipe)
- Composting food waste that I cannot use
