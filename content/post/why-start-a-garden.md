Have you ever thought about starting a garden but wondered if it's worth the effort? No matter how big of a yard you have, you still can -- and should! -- start a garden of your own this year!

## 1. Cost Efficiency.
Let's talk money, maybe the biggest motivator for some. Starting a garden can be a smart financial move! Trips to the grocery store for fresh produce can add up over time, and you're additionally paying for the costs of shipping and packaging the produce you buy. By growing your own fruits and veggies, you're creating a supply right in your backyard. With a bit of care and attention, a small initial investment in seeds and tools can translate into a bountiful harvest at a much cheaper price per pound than you can get from the grocery store.

## 2. Environmental Impact
Climate action starts at home, and a garden can have a great impact on your carbon footprint! We all learn in school that plants remove carbon dioxide from the air and convert it to oxygen through photosynthesis. But they also contribute to the environment in a multitude of other ways. Plants enrich and stabilize the soil climate, and even contribute moisture to the air. (I recommend you check out this interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zarll9bx6FI&ab_channel=TED-Ed) by TED-Ed about how trees can help an urban climate!) In addition, planting your own garden means that you can save the carbon cost of shipping produce around the globe to get to the grocery shelves. Shipping emissions contributed nearly 700 million metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere in 2021 alone! By planting your own garden, you're taking the shipping chain as short as it can get: garden-to-table!  

## 3. Quality, Quality, Quality
When you grow your own garden, you're in control: you know what goes in the soil, and you can be confident that there aren't traces of pesticides or unknown chemicals on your produce. Who needs an organic label when it's straight from your garden? Even better, a tomato straight from the vine is guaranteed to be much fresher and more flavorful than one that was picked days ago on a different continent. I am a big subscriber to the Alice Waters philosophy: if it was grown well, you can taste the difference!

## 4. Access to Cultural Ingredients
As a child, I read the book _The Ugly Vegetables_ by Grace Lin. The story is about how her mother planted Chinese vegetables in the garden to be able to make soup. This experience is actually not uncommon to many people like me in the Asian diaspora -- and likely in others as well! Even living near a big city, access to produce not popular in the West can be limited, since most stores don't carry it. The nearest grocery store that sells some of these vegetables is nearly an hour drive away. But you can get easy access to a lot of "exotic" produce by just growing it yourself! While tropical fruits may be difficult to grow if you live in a temperate climate, many other things like leafy vegetables and peppers are easy to grow at home. I found [The Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-grow-chinese-vegetables-in-your-garden/) to be a helpful resource when planting Chinese vegetables in a temperate climate. This year, I successfully grew a plot of garlic chives and green onions, which has saved us many a grocery trip and allowed us to cook some comforting traditional food at home! You can find seeds online, or source them from others starting gardens in the community.

## 5. Community & Personal Fulfillment
That brings me to my next point! Gardening can be a great source of personal connection and fulfillment. I regularly volunteer with the organization [Haley House](), a soup kitchen and farm providing free meals to those in need in Boston. Working with friends or family in the soil is a great way to spend time together. And spending time outside has shown to be good for both mental and physical health; taking care of living things and witnessing their growth is not only rewarding but also a fantastic stress-reliever. Your garden becomes a sanctuary of calm, a place to unwind, connect with nature, and find a sense of accomplishment in your green endeavors. Furthermore, you'll find there's a wonderful community of gardeners out there. Since starting a garden, I've learned from and enjoyed connecting with so many people -- from a neighbor to a friend's mom to a stranger on the bus -- about the ups and downs of growing your own plants.

Starting a garden isn't just about planting seeds â€“ it's a journey towards being a more sustainable and fulfilled person. From the altruistic to the self-improving, there's a world of reasons to start your own garden. So it's about time to get your hands in the soil and embark on a green revolution! Happy gardening!
