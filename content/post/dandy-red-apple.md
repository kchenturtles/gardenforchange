This is a very New England apple -- it's only grown by two farms, as far as I can tell! I picked this apple up at the Belmont Farmer's Market. It's in the McIntosh family, apparently a cross between the Mac itself and Paula Red. Supposedly it's quite similar to a Paula Red as well (I've never had a Paula Red apple, so I can't be sure), but nevertheless, I enjoyed giving this one a try! Visually, the Dandy Red is a large, rounded apple. It's mostly red -- quite a dark red with light lenticels, like most in the Paula Red family -- but has a little bit of green patching around the stem end. 

The Dandy Red tastes a lot like a McIntosh (which makes sense, since one of its parents is the Mac itself and the other parent is a child of the Mac) but it's a little bit firmer. It's got smooth, fine-grained flesh with an almost velvety texture. The skin's slightly chewy like a McIntosh, and it has a similar vinous flavor with hints of berry. Overall, a pretty good apple, but to be honest I probably couldn't distinguish this from a good ol' McIntosh. Worth the extra bucks? Probably not.
